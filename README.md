# clock-app
a simple clock/alarm app for my raspberry pi, but it can be built for any major os or distro

### usage instructions since not everyone here is a super mega nerd who knows how to use electron applications
- first things first, im not gonna build it for you i'm too tired (so youre gonna have to deal with just running it from source)
- step 1: download this whole repository with the green button up there
- step 2: opne it in terminal
- step 3: before step 2 (or after if you didnt read ahead and just blindly followed step 2), make sure nodejs and npm are installed
- step 4: run `npm audit fix --force` this will either install all the dependencies or break everything
- step 5: run `npm run start` and enjoy the worst clock app to ever be released on github or any software ditribution platform
